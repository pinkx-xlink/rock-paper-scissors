Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors Project (JavaScript)

To create this game I followed the following tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rock-paper-and-scissor-game-using-javascript/

Notes to self:
- need to make player & computer score adjust as each round ends
- make game end after 10 rounds - ask if player wants to restart or end game
